&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2020/04/26: Identified that the text in the application could potentially cause public panic:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a user taps the “upload my data” button the next screen asserts “You have tested positive for COVID-19” which may be a false assertion and cause confusion. This text needs changing. Since the user is only supposed to upload data when asked to by a health official (see the previous screen), this statement should reiterate that data should not be uploaded UNLESS you have tested positive. It’s possible that uploading data without having tested positive will result in unnecessary and false notifications being sent to other users&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;li&gt;2020/04/28: Mother-of-two Holly Donovan from Frankston panicked when she thought the app had diagnosed her with coronavirus.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confusion and privacy concerns have grown over the federal government's COVIDSafe app, with one Melbourne woman saying a puzzling message led her to believe she had contracted the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mother-of-two Holly Donovan from Frankston panicked when she thought the app had diagnosed her with coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message &amp;quot;You have tested positive for COVID-19&amp;quot; appeared when she tapped the button &amp;quot;has a heath official asked you to upload your data?&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		<title>Rural And Remote Australians On Telstra Cannot Register</title>
		<link href="https://covidsafe.watch/issue-register/rural-and-remote-australians-on-telstra-cannot-register" />
		<updated />

&lt;?# Twitter 1254499854245433344 /?&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many rural Australians aren't able to register for the app at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to register for COVIDSafe, users need to be sent an SMS verification. This two-factor authentication (2FA) is for security purposes and in general is a good feature of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this becomes problematic if you live in an area with patchy or no mobile service. And this is the issue that many rural Australians are now facing. If you can't get the SMS, you can't use COVIDSafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For rural Aussies – or even just those who live in a mobile black spot – who are on plans with Vodafone and Optus, excluding prepaid, this isn't a problem. With these providers, they're able to still receive the verification text because these telcos offer SMS Over WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, users who are with Telstra or some Mobile virtual Network Operator (MVNO) resellers don't have the SMS over WiFi option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2020/05/telstra-sms-over-wifi-launch/"&gt;https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2020/05/telstra-sms-over-wifi-launch/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="resolution"&gt;Resolution&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;?# Twitter 1257902961780387840 /?&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Telstra customers in areas that do not have mobile coverage are unable to send or receive SMS over WiFi. We have been working to introduce this capability into the network and will now accelerate the work required. We are also working closely with the DTA on alternative methods for the COVIDSafe app to send an authentication code,&amp;quot; a Telstra spokesperson said in an email to Gizmodo Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The government is aware that Telstra handsets presently do not support SMS over wi-fi, meaning that those in areas with poor mobile coverage may experience challenges in completing the process to download and register the COVIDSafe App (as the process involves receiving a code via SMS),&amp;quot;a spokesperson for the Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts, Paul Fletcher, said in an email to Gizmodo Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Telstra's statement indicated that it was working on introducing SMS Over Wifi, no time frame was given. Telstra has now confirmed with Gizmodo Australia that the feature has begun rolling out on iOS and Samsung devices as of today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;SMS over WiFi updates for customers’ smartphones have gone live overnight and will roll out progressively over the next seven days. Some Telstra customers will already see the functionality available on their devices.&amp;quot; said a Telstra spokesperson in an email tp Gizmodo Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content>&lt;h1 id="overview"&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been no roadmap published by the DTA. We sometimes hear through the media that an update may be coming, but we don't know what that update will contain until it is published, and then it is just the brief release notes on the app stores or we compare the decompiled app with the previous version. The only certain item that has been mentioned several times is that they are planning to integrate the Exposure Notification APIs developed by Apple and Google. But there has been no mention or discussion by the DTA on what this integration may involve.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Out of App Record Keeping.</title>
		<link href="https://covidsafe.watch/issue-register/out-of-app-recordkeeping" />
		<updated />
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Issues relating to how the Australian Government Federal, State and Local are endorsing / compelling citizens to record information outside the COVIDSafe application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biosecurity Act received amendments which provide legal constraints of how information is stored during COVID and specifically its disposal.  There is no such legislation in place to cover the same conditions of collection and disposal outside the COVIDSafe Application context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="th-may-2020"&gt;15th May 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;?# Twitter 1261109562498637824 /?&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Queensland &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;relaxes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; lockdown constraints to enable Restaurants, Cafes, Pubs, Clubs, RSL clubs and Hotels to open doors for up to maximum 10 customers per venue. A detailed checklist provided to ensure any of the business mentioned above types must abide by before opening for trade (&lt;a href="https://www.covid19.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/127235/COVID-Safe-Checklist-RestCafes.pdf"&gt;https://www.covid19.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/127235/COVID-Safe-Checklist-RestCafes.pdf&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Queensland business required to keep records of customers before trade commences, specifically they are required to ask customers for their &lt;strong&gt;name, address and mobile phone number&lt;/strong&gt; of a &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt; at each table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No current legislation beyond Privacy Act 1988 provides any legal coverage as to what business is required to do with the information gathered during the COVID outbreak, specifically with regards to the checklist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses are less likely to provide visible terms and conditions of privacy before patrons entering the above business types, mainly, they are less likely to demonstrate to patrons how their information is likely to be used once requested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Queensland's checklist has no relationship to COVIDSafe application, moreover should a patron have the application installed they are still required to give the same information again, despite such information existing inside the applications registration process (effectively reducing the value proposition of the COVIDSafe application).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVIDSafe application has had an amendment (&lt;a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2020L00480"&gt;https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2020L00480&lt;/a&gt;) to the Biosecurity Act to provide specific coverage for how privacy and use of such data are to be used however it is also worth noting that such coverage limited to the application only. Out of Application record-keeping (using the same information as the COVIDSafe app) has no such coverage or legal constraints, effectively ensuring duplication of data lives under two sets of legal constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Queensland Checklist provides no legal recourse should a business choose to use the records outside the COVID period, mainly if a business were to use such information for marketing, statistical or other reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No verification or validation of a customer's records are in place; specifically if a customer were to provide fake information, there is no explicit legal action that could be taken against the said customer(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Zealand has used a similar process by way of asking businesses to record customer information. Recently, a Subway worker found to have abused the records of a female customer by using such records to stalk her (&lt;a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2020/05/14/woman-stalked-by-sandwich-server-via-her-covid-19-contact-tracing-info/"&gt;https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2020/05/14/woman-stalked-by-sandwich-server-via-her-covid-19-contact-tracing-info/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unclear specifically if law enforcement may or may not compel a business to provide information retained by businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business are requested to store customers in a secure manner, but no specific governance or guidance is provided on what is considered reasonably secure - Hand written records stored on a notepad, excel spreadsheet of customer information on a open terminal etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: &lt;strong&gt;Queensland Attorney-General and Minister for Justice / Shadow Minister(s) have been notified formally for response to these set of issues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s forthcoming contact tracing app will be fundamentally different to Singapore’s TraceTogether, with improvements having already been made to the latter's functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acting health department secretary Caroline Edwards told a senate inquiry into COVID-19 on Thursday that although the app is derived from TraceTogether, its code base will be unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think the Singapore TraceTogether app is the model,” she said in response to questions from Labor senator Murray Watt, adding that it has been an “important contributor”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Australia’s app, which is being developed by the Digital Transformation Agency, is expected to build on TraceTogether elements, particularly around Bluetooth on iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwards said that the DTA app would not need to constantly run in the foreground for contacts to be recorded, although he admitted Bluetooth would work better with the app open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim Mussared is one Australian developer who's been working on uncovering the app's flaws to ensure it's doing what it's meant to. For him, it's made one thing particularly clear — the DTA hasn't been easy to work with when it comes to disclosing bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Seeing the source code allows us to do a direct comparison to the Singapore [TraceTogether] code,&amp;quot; Mussared said to Gizmodo Australia over email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;One very clear result of this is that there were zero functional changes to the iOS BLE backgrounding behaviour (CentralController.swift). We know that the Singapore team knew that background-to-background iPhone didn't work, so any claims by the DTA that they 'fixed it' indicate that either they never actually tested [or] investigated it, or their testing methodology was flawed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This document describes a bug as observed in the COVIDSafe iOS application, causing it to be much less effective than it could be, while the application is not in the foreground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="repeated-scanning-for-peripherals-and-not-in-the-background"&gt;Repeated scanning for peripherals (and not in the background)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The below reproducible output shows evidence of the iOS application continually initiating scans in the foreground, and never initiating in the background. A Frida script hooks the CBCentralManager scanForPeripheralsWithServices method, and displays the first argument (the app’s service UUID) when run. When the application is in foreground state, the scan is run every minute. Once the app goes into the background, we don’t observe any scans, and stopScan has been called meaning the bluetooth central manager will not send any more discovered peripherals in central mode. When it’s put in the foreground again, the scan runs again. Be sure to run this without other devices interfering. Timestamps are important, the app starts in the foreground. Important to note is that it’s not actually required in iOS to continue requesting a scan. This only needs to happen once, and iOS will call centralManager(_:didDiscover:advertisementData:rssi:) when a peripheral is discovered in future, with some limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="debug-breakpoints"&gt;Debug Breakpoints&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further evidence can be seen by setting up a debugger on the COVIDSafe app. Using a disassembler, you can find the entry point of the delegate method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;centralManager(_:didDiscover:advertisementData:rssi:)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This delegate method tells the delegate the central manager discovered a peripheral while scanning for devices. In the COVIDSafe binary, this method is at address 0x100055c14. To set a breakpoint, you first need to calculate the ASLR offset. You can do this by using lldb to show where the COVIDSafe image is based. Here’s a video that shows the breakpoint correctly hitting once the second iOS device runs the scan (when the app is opened). This doesn’t show it not occuring (the above script does), but that would have been a very long video, as the breakpoint never occurs. This follows from the above evidence that scan results are not sent to the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-bug"&gt;The Bug&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COVIDSafe application code is derived from Opentrace. In the OpenTrace source code, it sets up a timer to run here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/opentrace-community/opentrace-ios/blob/75fc506bef34ba48a727f9758f94823b9b4a2286/OpenTrace/Bluetrace/CentralController.swift#L86"&gt;https://github.com/opentrace-community/opentrace-ios/blob/75fc506bef34ba48a727f9758f94823b9b4a2286/OpenTrace/Bluetrace/CentralController.swift#L86&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem here is that it is continuously starting and stopping scans, using a timer. When the application is put into the background, the timer started on the main thread’s execution is paused, and scans do not run. When the application enters the foreground again, it runs immediately because the timer suddenly expires. It then may run again shortly after (as seen in the script output above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling stopScan ensures that peripherals discovered on future system scan results are not reported to the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the evidence of the behaviour above, we can readily believe that this bug (or a variant of) has been copied to the Australian COVIDSafe application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-fix"&gt;The Fix&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the application only needs to call scanForPeripherals once. I have an example project which continues to get peripheral discovery callbacks when it is in the background. The key to this, apart from not continuously starting and stopping scans is to set CBCentralManagerScanOptionAllowDuplicatesKey to true, allowing multiple discoveries of the same peripheral. The behaviour of this changes in the background, but on system scans devices continue to be reported to the app (multiple times). Example output from the application is at the bottom of this document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="frida-trace-with-no-other-devices"&gt;Frida Trace with no other devices&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frida-trace output of the COVIDSafe app showing timings, application going from foreground to background, stopScan being called, and then scan resuming in foreground. No other devices with the COVIDSafe app in the foreground were present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lifetime of this ID is important because it will uniquely identify your phone for this time interval. It doesn't say who you are, but it allows any Bluetooth device in range to know that it's the same phone it saw earlier. A simple example of how this could be abused is that it allows someone to track your movement as your ID shows up in multiple locations. Devices recording these IDs could provide effective distributed location tracing. This is why it's very important that the same ID is used for the shortest possible period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A slightly more complicated example is that if I already know who someone is and can record their ID (by being within 20 metres of them for a few seconds), then I now can track that exact person. This would be especially worrying to victims of domestic violence (also note that the issues described here do not require access to an unlocked phone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors: Jim Mussared (micropython.org), Alwen Tiu (The Australian National University)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vulnerability has been identified in the implementation of the Android version of Australia's COVIDSafe contact tracing app that may affect several other contact tracing apps that share a similar architecture, such as Singapore's TraceTogether and Alberta's ABTraceTogether. This issue is being tracked using the CVE ID CVE-2020-12856. The vulnerability allows for long term tracking of users of the affected apps, and possibly enables other bluetooth-based attack vectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details of the issue are still currently under embargo, until the developers of the affected apps have been notified and given a chance to put in place mitigation strategies. After the embargo period ends, more details of the issue will be published here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From: &lt;a href="https://github.com/alwentiu/COVIDSafe-CVE-2020-12856"&gt;https://github.com/alwentiu/COVIDSafe-CVE-2020-12856&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be applied in a couple of different ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPhone. Although it still only requires simple equipment and limited expertise, it's harder to pull off. However, it allows for permanent tracking of an iPhone even when the COVIDSafe app is uninstalled. This gives access to the full device name normally hidden on iPhone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android. This allows for simple long-term tracking of an Android device (similar in execution to Issue #1 and #2) while the app is still installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike issue &lt;a href="https://covidsafe.watch/issue-register/CVE-2020-12857-tempid-identifier-was-static"&gt;CVE-2020-12857&lt;/a&gt; and Issue #2, this persists after reboot on both iPhone and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This applies to all contact tracing apps based on a similar protocol (e.g. confirmed for UK, Singapore)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly recommend that the Google/Apple protocol is adopted instead. When possible I will add mitigation details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Lacking an official disclosure/bug bounty program, we have now (5:00pm on 05/05/2020) raised this informally with the DTA and ASD/ACSC though available channels, with as much detail as possible.&lt;/li&gt;

		<title>CVE-2020-12717 - iOS Bluetooth Denial of Service</title>
		<link href="https://covidsafe.watch/issue-register/cve-2020-12717-ios-bluetooth-denial-of-service" />
		<updated />
		<content>&lt;h1 id="overview"&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVIDSafe for iOS, versions 1.0 and 1.1 contain a denial of service vulnerability, inherited from the OpenTrace code. The coding error allows an attacker within Bluetooth range to crash the application. This causes no further records of contacts to be stored until the user manually reopens the application. Only when the exploit is stopped, or the user is out of range, is the application able to run again. If attackers (such as a misguided group of activists) were motivated to disrupt the COVIDSafe system, they could use this bug to prevent contact exchanges in busy, popular areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;?# Youtube 7UdVHB1ohNo /?&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bug also affected Singapore’s TraceTogether, Alberta’s ABTraceTogether and Poland’s ProteGO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fairly obvious bug that should have been picked up in an automated scan and/or an in-depth security review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model that governments have chosen to build on OpenTrace has made the disclosure process extremely painful. It seems as though each government received a code drop of OpenTrace at some point in time, and from there on there was little to no communication. There’s no central repository they all build upon, no process for communicating bugs up or downstream, and in fact no security contacts that we could find at all. we tried contacting each entity separately through the traditional support request forms, but did not get a response from any, apart from the DTA who we happened to have a specific email address for. If they had followed an established upstream/downstream model or all contributed to a monorepo, there would have been significant advantages to all involved.
As much as was my wish, it seemed impossible to coordinate disclosure between all affected entities. And there could be more affected applications that we just don’t know about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The response from the disclosure of this particular vulnerability was very positive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6/5/20 22:57: Information of bug shared with DTA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7/5/20 07:54: Response confirming receipt and that they were looking into it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7/5/20 13:13: DTA confirmed the bug and that they would have a fix in the next release&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8/5/20 19:03: DTA said they had fixed the bug and shared a timeframe for fix, and that upgrade advice for users would be settled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14/5/20: Fix released to users in the App Store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fast response, continuous updates with a good outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s forthcoming contact tracing app will be fundamentally different to Singapore’s TraceTogether, with improvements having already been made to the latter's functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acting health department secretary Caroline Edwards told a senate inquiry into COVID-19 on Thursday that although the app is derived from TraceTogether, its code base will be unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think the Singapore TraceTogether app is the model,” she said in response to questions from Labor senator Murray Watt, adding that it has been an “important contributor”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Australia’s app, which is being developed by the Digital Transformation Agency, is expected to build on TraceTogether elements, particularly around Bluetooth on iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwards said that the DTA app would not need to constantly run in the foreground for contacts to be recorded, although he admitted Bluetooth would work better with the app open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim Mussared is one Australian developer who's been working on uncovering the app's flaws to ensure it's doing what it's meant to. For him, it's made one thing particularly clear — the DTA hasn't been easy to work with when it comes to disclosing bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Seeing the source code allows us to do a direct comparison to the Singapore [TraceTogether] code,&amp;quot; Mussared said to Gizmodo Australia over email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;One very clear result of this is that there were zero functional changes to the iOS BLE backgrounding behaviour (CentralController.swift). We know that the Singapore team knew that background-to-background iPhone didn't work, so any claims by the DTA that they 'fixed it' indicate that either they never actually tested [or] investigated it, or their testing methodology was flawed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This document describes a bug as observed in the COVIDSafe iOS application, causing it to be much less effective than it could be, while the application is not in the foreground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="repeated-scanning-for-peripherals-and-not-in-the-background"&gt;Repeated scanning for peripherals (and not in the background)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The below reproducible output shows evidence of the iOS application continually initiating scans in the foreground, and never initiating in the background. A Frida script hooks the CBCentralManager scanForPeripheralsWithServices method, and displays the first argument (the app’s service UUID) when run. When the application is in foreground state, the scan is run every minute. Once the app goes into the background, we don’t observe any scans, and stopScan has been called meaning the bluetooth central manager will not send any more discovered peripherals in central mode. When it’s put in the foreground again, the scan runs again. Be sure to run this without other devices interfering. Timestamps are important, the app starts in the foreground. Important to note is that it’s not actually required in iOS to continue requesting a scan. This only needs to happen once, and iOS will call centralManager(_:didDiscover:advertisementData:rssi:) when a peripheral is discovered in future, with some limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id="debug-breakpoints"&gt;Debug Breakpoints&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further evidence can be seen by setting up a debugger on the COVIDSafe app. Using a disassembler, you can find the entry point of the delegate method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;centralManager(_:didDiscover:advertisementData:rssi:)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This delegate method tells the delegate the central manager discovered a peripheral while scanning for devices. In the COVIDSafe binary, this method is at address 0x100055c14. To set a breakpoint, you first need to calculate the ASLR offset. You can do this by using lldb to show where the COVIDSafe image is based. Here’s a video that shows the breakpoint correctly hitting once the second iOS device runs the scan (when the app is opened). This doesn’t show it not occuring (the above script does), but that would have been a very long video, as the breakpoint never occurs. This follows from the above evidence that scan results are not sent to the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-bug"&gt;The Bug&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COVIDSafe application code is derived from Opentrace. In the OpenTrace source code, it sets up a timer to run here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/opentrace-community/opentrace-ios/blob/75fc506bef34ba48a727f9758f94823b9b4a2286/OpenTrace/Bluetrace/CentralController.swift#L86"&gt;https://github.com/opentrace-community/opentrace-ios/blob/75fc506bef34ba48a727f9758f94823b9b4a2286/OpenTrace/Bluetrace/CentralController.swift#L86&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem here is that it is continuously starting and stopping scans, using a timer. When the application is put into the background, the timer started on the main thread’s execution is paused, and scans do not run. When the application enters the foreground again, it runs immediately because the timer suddenly expires. It then may run again shortly after (as seen in the script output above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling stopScan ensures that peripherals discovered on future system scan results are not reported to the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the evidence of the behaviour above, we can readily believe that this bug (or a variant of) has been copied to the Australian COVIDSafe application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-fix"&gt;The Fix&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the application only needs to call scanForPeripherals once. I have an example project which continues to get peripheral discovery callbacks when it is in the background. The key to this, apart from not continuously starting and stopping scans is to set CBCentralManagerScanOptionAllowDuplicatesKey to true, allowing multiple discoveries of the same peripheral. The behaviour of this changes in the background, but on system scans devices continue to be reported to the app (multiple times). Example output from the application is at the bottom of this document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="frida-trace-with-no-other-devices"&gt;Frida Trace with no other devices&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frida-trace output of the COVIDSafe app showing timings, application going from foreground to background, stopScan being called, and then scan resuming in foreground. No other devices with the COVIDSafe app in the foreground were present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
