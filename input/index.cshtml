<p class="lead text-white">We want to see lives saved through the use of this unprecedented technology.</p>

<p class="lead text-white">It is crucial to us that privacy and security issues are addressed promptly and communicated in an inclusive and open manner.</p>

<p class="lead text-white">We believe transparency is essential to achieve both of these goals without compromising either.
Compromising privacy risks people’s lives by undermining public trust in the systems built to protect them.</p>

<p class="lead text-white">This can only be achieved by direct collaboration with engineers using transparent open source collaborative platforms just as the <a href="https://twitter.com/NHSX/status/1258453749691027465?s=19">UK National Health Service</a>, and the <a href="https://tcn-coalition.org/members/">TCN Coalition</a> is doing.</p>
