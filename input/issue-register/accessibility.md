> Vision and hearing-impaired people are also at a disadvantage in using the app. Testing by disability groups has found that it is not fully screen reader accessible, and there is no known Auslan guide on access and use. There is an urgent need for immediate consultation with this community to enable accessibility features to be built into the app design and inform any future iterations
