- 2020/04/26: Identified that the text in the application could potentially cause public panic:

> When a user taps the “upload my data” button the next screen asserts “You have tested positive for COVID-19” which may be a false assertion and cause confusion. This text needs changing. Since the user is only supposed to upload data when asked to by a health official (see the previous screen), this statement should reiterate that data should not be uploaded UNLESS you have tested positive. It’s possible that uploading data without having tested positive will result in unnecessary and false notifications being sent to other users
